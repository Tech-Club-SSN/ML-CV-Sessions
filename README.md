# ML-CV-Sessions
Materials for the ML/CV sessions. (2018-2019).

Due to time constraints, we were not able to utilize all the material that we created for the sessions. As of now, this repository only contains the notebooks we used in the July-August sessions. We will update this repo with the other materials soon.
